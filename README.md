# pict

The Plant insect Interactions Camera Trap (PICT), is a DIY, low-cost, weather-resistant camera designed to be autonomous, energy efficient and modular. Its architecture is based on a Raspberry Pi single board computer.

This git repository aims at providing the resources to build a PICT from a Raspberry Pi Zero and the appropriate peripherals including a camera.

## Documentation

The method is described in a paper in Method in Ecology and Evolution :
https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.13618

A user manual is periodically updated and can be downloaded from:
https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4139838

It is also provided in the [doc](doc/) folder.

## Build a prototype

### Hardware

- Raspberry Pi Zero board

- Micro SD card and adapter to your desktop computer (either micro SD-to-SD, either micro SD-to-USB)

- Camera (...)

- Camera cable (...)

- Mini HDMI-to-HDMI adapter

- Micro USB-to-USB adapter

Note that mini HDMI-to-HDMI and micro USB-to-USB are commonly sold together as a Raspberry Pi Zero adapter kit.

- Micro-USB charger

- Multi-USB dispatcher, to which are connected a USB mouse and a USB keyboard

- Computer screen with a HDMI cable

### Flash the OS

### Set up the Raspberry board


## Scale up

Now that we have a working prototype, the next step will be to clone it to as many PICT as needed.

The hardware of each PICT has to be build as described in the doc file.

The software can be cloned from one SD card to the user using (...).

## Post-hoc analysis

Post-hoc analysis can be achieved using the matlab script provided in the [src](src/) folder.
